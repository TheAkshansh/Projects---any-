            <h2 class="aaa">Goal 1: No Poverty (End poverty in all its forms everywhere)</h1>
            <p>Eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030 is a pivotal goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.<br> Extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per person per day at 2017 purchasing power parity, has witnessed remarkable declines over recent decades. <br>However, the emergence of COVID-19 marked a turning point, reversing these gains as the number of individuals living in extreme poverty increased for the first time in a generation by almost 90 million over previous predictions. <br>
                Even prior to the pandemic, the momentum of poverty reduction was slowing down. <br>By the end of 2022, nowcasting suggested that 8.4 per cent of the world’s population, or as many as 670 million people, could still be living in extreme poverty. <br>This setback effectively erased approximately three years of progress in poverty alleviation.<br>
                If current patterns persist, an estimated 7% of the global population – around 575 million people – could still find themselves trapped in extreme poverty by 2030, with a significant concentration in sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
                A shocking revelation is the resurgence of hunger levels to those last observed in 2005. <br>Equally concerning is the persistent increase in food prices across a larger number of countries compared to the period from 2015 to 2019.<br> This dual challenge of poverty and food security poses a critical global concern.</p>
