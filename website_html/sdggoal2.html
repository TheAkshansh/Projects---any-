            <p>Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. <br>The triple burden of malnutrition – undernutrition, hidden hunger and overweight – threatens the survival, growth and development of children and young people. Well-nourished children are better able to grow and learn, to participate in their communities and to be resilient in the face of disease, disaster and other emergencies. <br>Estimates from 2019 show that nearly 690 million people were hungry in that year, or 8.9 per cent of the world’s population. Children and young people shoulder the greatest burden of all forms of malnutrition from the poorest and most marginalized communities. <br> Worldwide, nearly half of all deaths in children under 5 are attributable to undernutrition.  In 2019, 144 million children under 5, or 21.3 per cent were stunted, 47 million or 6.9 per cent, were wasted (of which 14.3 million were severely wasted) and 38 million, or 5.6 per cent, were overweight. <br> Malnutrition during pregnancy can also affect nutrition outcomes in children, notably one third of females aged 15 to 49 years worldwide were affected by anemia in 2016, with no notable change over the last 2 decades. </p>
