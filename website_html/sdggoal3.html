            <p>Goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages. Health and well-being are important at every stage of one’s life, starting from the beginning. <br> This goal addresses all major health priorities: reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health; communicable and non-communicable diseases; universal health coverage; <br> and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. SDG 3 aims to prevent needless suffering from preventable diseases and premature death by focusing on key targets that boost the health of a country’s overall population.<br> Regions with the highest burden of disease and neglected population groups and regions are priority areas. <br> It also calls for deeper investments in research and development, health financing and health risk reduction and management.<br>
                UNICEF’s role in contributing to Goal 3 centres on healthy pregnancies (maternal mortality and skilled birth attendant), <br>healthy childhoods (under-five and neonatal mortality) as well as vaccine coverage. <br> UNICEF also contributes to monitoring elements of the universal health coverage indicator.</p>
