            <p class="intro">The <b>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,</b> adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, 
                now and into the future. At its heart are the <b>17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),</b> 
                which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations 
                must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth - all while tackling climate change and 
                working to preserve our oceans and forests. <br> <br>The SDGs build on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 178 countries adopted Agenda 21,</b> a comprehensive plan of action to build a global partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment.
                <br>Member States unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 at UN Headquarters in New York.<br> The Summit led to the elaboration of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty by 2015.
                <br>The <b>Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation,</b> adopted at the <b>World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa in 2002,</b> reaffirmed the global community's commitments to poverty eradication and the environment, and built on Agenda 21 and the Millennium Declaration by including more emphasis on multilateral partnerships. <br>
                At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, Member States adopted the outcome document <b>"The Future We Want"</b> in which they decided, inter alia, to launch a process to develop a set of SDGs to build upon the MDGs and to establish the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.<br> Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more.</p>
